# Project Inspiration
This morning, I asked myself: "Can Streamlit be used for something it wasn't intended for? For example, can it be used to create a video game?"

Driven by my passion for unconventional thinking, I decided to try implementing Snake, the famous '90s mobile game, on Streamlit. ðŸŽ®
# Challenges and Development
I encountered various challenges and limitations during development. However, in the end, I managed to achieve an acceptable result using only the components offered by Streamlit.

# Project Outcome
My goal was to see if I could recreate something like Snake with Streamlit, and I am satisfied with the outcome!

Although I don't plan to refine the project further, the interface could be customized even more by creating specific rules for each component using CSS.
